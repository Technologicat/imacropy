"""IPython extension for a MacroPy-enabled REPL.

To enable::

    %load_ext imacropy.iconsole

To autoload it at IPython startup, put this into your ``ipython_config.py``::

    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = ["imacropy.iconsole"]

To find your config file, ``ipython profile locate``.

Notes:

  - You can use the line magic `%macros` to print macros currently imported
    to the session.

  - Each time a ``from mymodule import macros, ...`` is executed in the REPL,
    the system reloads ``mymodule``, to use the latest macro definitions.

    Hence, semi-live updates to macro definitions are possible: hack on your
    macros, re-import, and try out the new version in the REPL; no need to restart
    the REPL session in between.

  - The set of macros available from ``mymodule``, at any given time, is those
    specified **in the most recent** ``from mymodule import macros, ...``.

    Any other macros from ``mymodule``, that were not specified in the most recent
    import, will be unloaded when the import is performed.

  - Each time after importing macros, the corresponding macro stubs are
    automatically imported as regular Python objects.

    Stubs are not directly usable. The intention is to let Python recognize
    the macro name (otherwise there would be no run-time object by that name),
    and to allow viewing macro docstrings and source code easily using
    ``some_macro?``, ``some_macro??``.

    This does not affect using the macros in the intended way, as macros,
    since macros are expanded away before run-time.
